Subject: Additional information on CVE-2014-2469?

Is there anyone from Oracle on the list? Does anyone have further 
information on CVE-2014-2469?
https://blogs.oracle.com/sunsecurity/entry/cve_2014_2469_denial_of

I assume that's a typo in the advisory and was meant to say lighttpd
instead of lighthttpd? If so, Is this Solaris/Oracle-specific?

Cheers,
