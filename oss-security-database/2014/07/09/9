About a month has passed since, at it seems this wasn't a one-off post.
As far as I can see, all FreeBSD security advisories released since
were posted here as well:

http://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories.html

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/05/20
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/24/17
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/24/18
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/07/08/17

It seems we need someone form FreeBSD team to change their system to
avoid posting all their errata here, or force moderation for all mails
from security-advisories@...ebsd.org.
