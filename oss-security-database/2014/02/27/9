Subject: Re: CVE request: PLOGGER 1.0RC1 multiple vulnerabilities

I think there is a mistake from our part about the "race condition".
After a quick review, there is no "race condition" but simply some
requirements about the zip file and a cleaning step that should not be
be performed by the application in order to keep all the files on the
server.

Here are the steps to follow to exploit this vulnerability:

1. create a zip file containing at least one non-empty image file with a
valid extension (such as .jpg)
2. upload the file through the upload form, the application will unzip
it in a standard location and will tell the user about the image files
found. If we go on at this step, all the extracted images will be
processed and all the extracted files then deleted. So we just stop
right here, and
3. access the php file extracted by the application

I don't know if I'm really clear about what happens,
