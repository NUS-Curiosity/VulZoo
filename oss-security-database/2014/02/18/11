Thanks for sending this note. To provide an initial response to this:
MITRE will look into the relationships among CVE-2013-4710,
CVE-2012-6636, and CVE-2014-1939, but at this point has not accepted
the statement that CVE-2014-1939 must be marked as a duplicate.

Again, from:

  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/08/8
  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ndss14nofrak.pdf

The scope of CVE-2012-6636 is the following description of a specific
change made by a vendor in response to a vulnerability:

  On Android prior to API level 17, these interfaces are
  generically insecure. Malicious JavaScript executing inside
  WebView can use the Java reflection API to invoke any method
  of any Java object exposed via 'addJavascriptInterface' and
  take control over the local side of the application.
  Starting from Android API level 17, only the methods explicitly
  annotated with @JavascriptInterface are visible in the Java
  objects exposed to WebView via 'addJavascriptInterface'.

The scope of CVE-2014-1939 is only the role of the
searchBoxJavaBridge_ object as a specific attackable object.

The outcome with respect to CVE-2013-4710 will depend on several
factors, including MITRE's assessment of whether the wider community
has been using CVE-2013-4710 for purposes other than tracking updates
offered by Japanese handset manufacturers.
