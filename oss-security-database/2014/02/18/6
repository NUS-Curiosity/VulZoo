Subject: CVE request: MaraDNS DoS due to incorrect bounds checking on certain strings

Hi, can a CVE be assigned to the following issue?

It was reported that MaraDNS's recursive resolver, Deadwood, suffers
from a flaw where string bounds checking was not done correctly under
certain circumstances. As a result, it was possible for a remote
attacker to send Deadwood a "packet of death", which would cause
Deadwood to crash. Upstream notes that it currently appears that this
attack can only be exploited by an IP address with a permission to
perform recursive queries against Deadwood.

It looks like these are the appropriate patches in git:
