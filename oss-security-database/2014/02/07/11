Subject: IcedTea-Web insecure temporary directory use - CVE-2013-6493

Hi!

IcedTea-Web version 1.4.2 released earlier this week fixes an issue
related to handling of the directory that is used to store sockets for
communication between in browser plugin, and JVM running applets.  The
directory was usually created in /tmp, using predictable name, and its
ownership and permissions were not checked.  This issue was reported by
Michael Scherer of Red Hat and was assigned CVE-2013-6493.
