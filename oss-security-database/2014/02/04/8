Does anyone have information indicating that two CVE-2001-#### IDs are
needed to cover the discoveries by Olaf Kirch and Tim Waugh 13 years
ago? This would be the case if, for example, there was a January 2001
a2ps package that fixed part of the problem with temporary files.
Admittedly, the practical value of two CVE-2001-#### IDs at present
may be extremely small.

The information does not seem to be in a2ps.git because data before
2004 is unavailable, e.g.,

  http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/a2ps.git/log/?ofs=100

Also:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27155
  You are not authorized to access bug #27155.

If (as we would expect) nobody is interested in checking that, we will
assign one CVE-2001-#### ID.

Finally, the earlier abstraction question is no longer relevant
because Jakub Wilk is apparently not the original discoverer of any
part of the problem. Specifically, this question:

  The original report notes there are calls to tempname_ensure(). If any
  of those are found to be vulnerable, would they use the same CVE number,
  or require a different one?

would only apply to a situation in which the spyname problem was a new
discovery in 2014.
