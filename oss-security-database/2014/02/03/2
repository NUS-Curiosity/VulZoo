The exploit by Rebel works as advertised. I've confirmed on a non-Ubuntu box 
after making some changes.

Attached find a kernel module I've authored that protects from the attack.

I'm sharing it for folks currently on vulnerable systems still waiting on
patches from their upstream.

 # make
 # insmod nox32recvmmsg.ko

note: rmmod'ing restores original (vulnerable) state.
