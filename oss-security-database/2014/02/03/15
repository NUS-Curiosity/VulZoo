Subject: Re: Persistent XSS in Wordpress 3.3.1+dfsg-1 (Packaged
 with Ubuntu 12.04.4)

This issue was reported 17 months ago https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21917
and can be mitigated by changing the wordpress default configuration.

Sorry folks, I just wanted everyone to know the full story.
