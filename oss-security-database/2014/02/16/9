Expanding on what I wrote earlier...

The Google security patch rewards program [5] rewards security
improvements in open source projects, such as GCC, llvm, and Android.
While I can't speak for the committee which approves these rewards,
I'd be happy to support and recommend rewards to any security
researcher who implements statically linked PIE support. In my mind,
there are three possible rewards here, one for GCC, llvm, and Android.
