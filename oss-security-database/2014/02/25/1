Subject: Re: CVE request: hexchat buffer overflow

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Are there realistic circumstances in which this crosses privilege
boundaries? The primary reference is mentioned at the top of
hexchat-overflow.txt but wasn't directly listed in the CVE request:

> It was super low severity

> I decided to try to make a working exploit out of this for fun.

We generally haven't been making CVE assignments for cases of desktop
applications in which crafted input is entered interactively in the
UI. The existence of a well-known flaw type (e.g., buffer overflow)
and the existence of code to generate the crafted input haven't been
considered relevant in the past.

Is the nature of the attack different here?
