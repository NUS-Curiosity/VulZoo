GnuTLS versions before 2.7.6 contained different bug that caused GnuTLS
to accept V1 intermediate CAs by default, while no V1 CAs were meant to
be accepted unless GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT or
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT verification flags were used.

This should get a separate CVE.
