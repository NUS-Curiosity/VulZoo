Subject: CVE request: XSS in MODX Revolution before 2.2.11

Hi,

Can I get a CVE for this issue?

MODX Revolution 2.2.11 release announcement:
http://modx.com/blog/2014/01/21/revolution-2.2.11%E2%80%94security-fixes-and-prevent-change-loss/
says
"Prevent XSS on actionVar in header.tpl in the Manager"

This is the git commit:
https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/commit/77463eb6a8090f474b04fdc1b72225cb93c558ea

I haven't found any other public sources / advisories for the XSS, so I
assume it was detected by the MODX devs themselves.


cu,
