We recognize that there's a significant number of issues that fall
into the general category of "it could be useful to draw attention to
this aspect of a security model, because the documentation is arguably
inconsistent or obscure, and this may result in risks to end users."
Currently, the scope of CVE identifiers doesn't really extend to these
types of "useful to draw attention" identifiers.

What we can do is assign a CVE ID if any vendor bundles a copy of
Redis with a default directory of /tmp, and decides to make a security
announcement about that. We feel there's a distinction between
"there's nothing stopping an end user from choosing a world-writable
dataset directory" and "it ships world-writable."
