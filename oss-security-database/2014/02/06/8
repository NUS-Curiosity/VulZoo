I believe that untarring files to a direct subdirectory of /tmp (at 
least without --keep-old-files) is a vulnerability, although admittedly 
with very low severity. If the tarball contained a "." file, then tar 
would change permissions of the destination directory, possibly making 
the directly accessible to other users. This is (similar to?) CWE-378.

As far as I can tell, this one is indeed hardening only.
