Subject: Re: CVE request: python-gnupg before 0.3.5 shell
 injection

Upstream has now released 0.3.6:
Fixed  Issue #98 : Rectified problems with earlier fix for shell
injection.
https://code.google.com/p/python-gnupg/

CVE request is still pending. I think we now need two:
1. Shell injection partly fixed in 0.3.5.
2. Incomplete fix for shell injection fixed in 0.3.6.
