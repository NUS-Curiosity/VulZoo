Use CVE-2014-1958 for changeset 14801.

There are at least two ways to handle the CVE assignments for the
other issues. The problem is that CVE-2014-1947 was originally bound
to the disclosure of "that's still 4 bytes too many" (in ImageMagick
6.5.4) but this is apparently not an accurate description of the
problem. (Possibly "4 bytes too many" was based on an incorrect
interpretation that "L%02ld" meant two four-byte integer values, going
into a single four-byte buffer.)

Option 1:

1a. REJECT CVE-2014-1947.

1b. Assign one new CVE-2014-#### ID for the vulnerability in older
ImageMagick versions that use the "L%02ld" string. The root cause here
is that the code did not cover the case of more than 99 layers, which
is apparently allowable but relatively uncommon. This has a resultant
buffer overflow, e.g, L99\0 is safe but L100\0 is unsafe. When the
overflow occurs, it can be described as "1 or more bytes too many."

1c. Assign another new CVE-2014-#### ID for the vulnerability in newer
ImageMagick versions that use the "L%06ld" string. The root cause here
is that the code did not recognize the relationship between the 8 (or
more) characters in "L%06ld" and the actual buffer size. This has a
resultant buffer overflow of "4 or more bytes too many."

Option 2:

2a. Keep CVE-2014-1947 for the above-mentioned vulnerability in older
ImageMagick versions. This preserves the original meaning of
CVE-2014-1947 as a vulnerability affecting (for example) ImageMagick
6.5.4.

2b. Assign a new CVE-2014-#### ID for the above-mentioned
vulnerability in newer ImageMagick versions.

(We will proceed with option 2 unless option 1 is substantially better
for someone.)
