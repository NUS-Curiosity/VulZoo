Subject: CVE request: POSH multiple vulnerabilities

We recently found four vulnerabilities in POSH web application, including:

1. Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting all POSH 3.X
versions prior to 3.3.0

An unauthenticated SQL injection is present and can be exploited to
extract data stored in database.


2. Design vulnerability affecting all POSH 3.X versions (no fix yet)

There is a design vulnerability in the way POSH stores users credentials
in the browser's cookie (POSH stores every user's password md5 hash
inside an unsecure cookie)

3. Arbitrary url redirection affecting all POSH 3.X versions (no fix yet)

This vulnerability is hardly exploitable but shows a lack of user input
validation.

4. Cross-Site scripting vulnerability affecting all POSH 3.X versions
(no fix yet)

We would like to request 4 CVEs for these vulnerabilities.
