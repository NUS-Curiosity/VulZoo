 release

Seems odd to be asking these questions without asking someone from the MediaWiki team involved (I doubt they are subscribed to oss-sec).  Given that Murray just posting what was written by upstream and even asked "if CVE worthy" I doubt he has the answers you're looking for.  =)

I've cc'd Markus Glaser to this as he sent out the notification to the mediawiki-announce list so he may have the insight you're looking for.
