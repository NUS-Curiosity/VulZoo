Subject: CVE request: MantisBT 1.2.13 SQL injection vulnerability

Greetings

Jakub Galczyk (HauntIT blog http://hauntit.blogspot.com/) discovered an 
SQL injection vulnerability issue affecting MantisBT >= 1.2.13.

admin_config_report.php relied on unsanitized, inlined query parameters, 
enabling a malicious user to perform an SQL injection attack.

The criticality of this issue is compounded by the fact that typically a 
high-privilege account (i.e. having an access level >= 
$g_view_configuration_threshold, which is set to ADMINISTRATOR by 
default) is required to access this page.

Patches are attached to [1]. Can you please assign a CVE ID to this issue ?

Thank you
