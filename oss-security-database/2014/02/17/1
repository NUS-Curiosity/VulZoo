Subject: CVE request: "imapsync ignores the --tls switch and sends my authentication
 plaintext."

Hello,

https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12770 notes that imapsync 1.584 
fixes a security issue, "Bug fix: Check if going to tls is ok, exit 
otherwise with explicit error message. Thanks to Dennis Schridde for 
reporting this ugly bug that deserves a CVE."

Upstream bug: https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/15

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?

Thanks,
