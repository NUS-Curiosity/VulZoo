MITRE may be making a CVE assignment for SECURITY-105, but it won't be
immediate because we need to discuss that one internally within our
team more. This is related to:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7285

not existing yet.

The vendor says "SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 / CVE-2013-5573" on that
"Jenkins Security Advisory 2014-02-14" page, but the originally
intended scope of CVE-2013-5573 is only the issue involving FORM
elements (aka SECURITY-88), not the issue involving IFRAME elements
(aka SECURITY-76). This may be just a parsing difference. We believe
it's:

   SECURITY-76 & ( SECURITY-88 / CVE-2013-5573 )

not:

   ( SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 ) / CVE-2013-5573

The commit that you didn't list is:

  https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/788b7d7a067fad4972fefaaa527141847bfeff55

The IFRAME issue wasn't part of the original disclosures such as
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/30408/ so we normally can't change
the scope of CVE-2013-5573 to include it later.
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/SECURITY-76 and
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/SECURITY-88 apparently are not
public, and could possibly have clarifying information (e.g., if there
were a later finding that only FORM is exploitable, and IFRAME isn't
actually exploitable). Unless that information becomes available and
suggests a different course of action, we will proceed to assign a new
CVE-2013-#### ID for SECURITY-76 soon.


> SECURITY-55
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/36342d71e29e0620f803a7470ce96c61761648d8

Use CVE-2013-7330.

Use CVE-2014-2058.

Use CVE-2014-2059.

Use CVE-2014-2060.


> SECURITY-93
> | The password input control in the password parameter definition in the
> | Jenkins UI was serving the actual value of the password in HTML, not an
> | encrypted one. If a sensitive value is set as the default value of such

> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/bf539198564a1108b7b71a973bf7de963a6213ef

Use CVE-2014-2061.


> SECURITY-89
> | Deleting the user was not invalidating the API token, allowing users to
> | access Jenkins when they shouldn't be allowed to do so.
> 
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5548b5220cfd496831b5721124189ff18fbb12a3

Use CVE-2014-2062.


> SECURITY-80
> | Jenkins UI was vulnerable to click jacking attacks.
> 
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/16931bd7bf7560e26ef98328b8e95e803d0e90f6

Use CVE-2014-2063.


> SECURITY-79

> | when login attempts fail.
> 
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/fbf96734470caba9364f04e0b77b0bae7293a1ec

Use CVE-2014-2064.


> SECURITY-77
> | Jenkins had a cross-site scripting vulnerability in one of its cookies.

> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/a0b00508eeb74d7033dc4100eb382df4e8fa72e7

Use CVE-2014-2065. This is an input-validation issue but perhaps
shouldn't be categorized as a standard XSS issue because of the
unusual threat model.


> SECURITY-75
> | Jenkins was vulnerable to session fixation attack. If Jenkins is

> | cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be exploited.
> 
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/8ac74c350779921598f9d5edfed39dd35de8842a

Use CVE-2014-2066. Again, the unusual threat model might limit the practical
relevance of this.


> SECURITY-74
> | Stored XSS vulnerability. A malicious user of Jenkins with a certain set
> | of permissions can cause Jenkins to store arbitrary HTML fragment.
> 
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5d57c855f3147bfc5e7fda9252317b428a700014

Use CVE-2014-2067.


> SECURITY-73
> | Some of the system diagnostic functionalities were checking a lesser
> | permission than it should have. In a very limited circumstances, this
> | can cause an attacker to gain information that he shouldn't have

> 
> https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/0530a6645aac10fec005614211660e98db44b5eb

Use CVE-2014-2068.
