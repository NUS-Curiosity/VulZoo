Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: nfs: information leakage

    Hello,

Linux kernel build with the NFS file system(CONFIG_NFS_FS) along with the 
support for NFSv4 protocol(CONFIG_NFS_V4) is vulnerable to an information 
leakage flaw. It could occur while writing to a file wherein NFS server has 
offered write delegation to the client. Such delegation allows NFS client to 
perform the said operation locally without instant interaction with the 
server.

A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/263b4509ec4d47e0da3e753f85a39ea12d1eff24

Thank you.
