Subject: CVE Request New-djbdns: dnscache: potential cache poisoning

   Hello,

Please see -> https://00f.net/2012/06/26/dnscache-poisoning-and-siphash/

===
...
By exploiting a hash table collision, an attacker has no way to trigger a DoS, 
but he can actually do something way more interesting: force the resolver to 
send the same query for the same TLD, over and over again, always to the same 
set of servers, no matter what the intended TTL is and no matter what the 
cache size is.

And suddenly, poisoning dnscache with a malicious TLD much, much, much easier 
and faster.
===

Not sure if it qualifies for a CVE; the excerpt above deems it a likely 
candidate.

Upstream fix:
