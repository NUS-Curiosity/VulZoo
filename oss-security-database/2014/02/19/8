This issue (or, in particular, its fix) is probably best considered a
security improvement, with no CVE assignment. As far as we can tell,
the code was attempting to implement and use djb33, and did actually
implement and use djb33 without a "software mistake" in the
traditional sense. Yes, we realize that there's a potentially
important and potentially simple attack possibility that could have
been avoided by not choosing djb33. That's not sufficient, however.
Also, in this case, some aspects of making a better choice (e.g., with
sufficiently fast and auditable pseudorandom hashing code) were
probably not even understood in the research community at the time the
software was originally written.

CVE does, as a secondary form of inclusion, cover vulnerability
advisories from a vendor who was the original author of a piece of
software and publishes a change as a required security update. That is
unlikely here; nobody is anticipating djbdns-1.06.
