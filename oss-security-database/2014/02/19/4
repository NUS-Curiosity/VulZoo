Use CVE-2014-2027.

We could not immediately determine whether the egroupware-1.8.005.txt
disclosure means that:

  Arbitrary file overwrite in __destruct:

  Remote code execution in __destruct:

are both exploitable only as a consequence of unsafe unserialize use.
If eliminating the unsafe unserialize use would not completely address
those issues, additional CVE IDs may be needed.

There are no new CVE assignments yet for possible other issues in the
1.8.006.20140217 changelog entry, such as:

  CalDAV/Calendar: fixed permanent auth request in iCal, if
  accountselection is set to "selectbox with groupmembers" and rights
  granted from group without being a member

  SiteMgr: fixed not working anonymous user and using now a random
  password
