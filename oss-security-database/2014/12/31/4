Subject: CVE Request: PHP: out of bounds read crashes php-cgi

Hi

Could you please assign a CVE to the following issue (in case it was
not requested to MITRE via seprate channel, thus also Cc'ing
StanislavStanislav Malyshev). 

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68618 (out of bounds read crashes
php-cgi).

PHP upstream has commited a fix for it to the VCS:

http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=f9ad3086693fce680fbe246e4a45aa92edd2ac35

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Salvatore
