  It seems to require 32bit interfaces(CONFIG_X86_32). On x86_64 Fedora/RHEL 
kernels, it says:

===
$ cat /etc/redhat-release 
Fedora release 21 (Twenty One)
$ 
$ cc -xc -o estest estest.c 
$ cc -xc -o gsbasetest gsbasetest.c 
$ 
$ ./estest 
estest: set_thread_area: Function not implemented
$ 
$ ./gsbasetest 
[OK]    ARCH_SET_GS worked
[OK]    Writing 0 to gs worked
[FAIL]  gsbase was corrupted
$
