Yes, we can proceed to CVE assignment. The more recent discussion
hasn't been on oss-security with, for example:

   https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux.git/commit/?h=x86/vdso&id=bc3b94c31d65e761ddfe150d02932c65971b74e2
   http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=141911002822659&w=2

This apparently mentions both the original discovery:

   The current algorithm is buggy: the vdso has about a 50%
   probability of being at the very end of a PMD.

and a second discovery that was made separately:

   The current algorithm also has a decent chance of failing outright
   due to incorrect handling of the case where the top of the stack is
   near the top of its PMD.

Here, our question, for anyone, is: is there a security impact from
the "failing outright" outcome? Or is there only a performance impact
(e.g., any correctly written application will continue to work, but
will not benefit from any vDSO functionality)?
