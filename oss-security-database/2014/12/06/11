Desktop files already work fine, so why fix what's not broken? I don't
think it should fall back to executing stuff at all. TBH, inspecting
file content rather than the Windows / OS X method of relying on the
file extension is quite surprising for a GUI file manager.

Everything is executable (by default) on FAT32/NTFS and you'll run into
fun surprises when there aren't proper shebangs. For example, a Python
module beginning with "import math" attempts to run the imagemagick
import command and grabs onto your mouse cursor. I don't even want to
begin thinking about the security implications of passing everything
through libmagic (ugh) and then opening it in an application *based on
the file content*, which is essentially opaque to the user.
