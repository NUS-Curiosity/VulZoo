Yup, it's a pretty lame excuse.

Firefox is only looking at using ASLR for the first time in 2014, and it
lost to supporting the workflow of opening Nautilus, navigating to some
directory and double-clicking the binary (could just be a wrapper...)
rather than using the .desktop file (or the CLI, or $LAUNCHER) or
shipping a script for this.

It's sad. Even if GNOME decides to add another hack to make this work,
it'll be 6 months to get it released and another 2-3 years before
Mozilla considers using it.

Meanwhile, plenty of other corporations (Valve, Google, [...]) are
shipping PIE binaries without trouble - their user-facing app launchers
even have icons, i18n and more in Nautilus, because they're not raw
binaries.
