Upstream asked for some basic fixes to the patch (i.e. it wasn't
submitted in the needed format) before it could accept it, so I doubt
it's rejected yet.

And of course a distro could backport and maintain it, it's a very tiny
patch, much smaller than what they normall backport.  Take it up with
the distros if you want this.
