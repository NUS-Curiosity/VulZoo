Time ago we assigned CVEs for world-readable logs produced by webservers in 
e.g. /var/log/$webserver/file.log . 
Nobody thought that make chmod o-r to the directory was the solution because 
is only a workaround.

I think that we have a similar scenario.

And I think it is more logical produce a dump with mode 600 instead of force 
million users to chmod the directory.
