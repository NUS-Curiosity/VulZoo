procmail already executes commands in lines starting with “|” (and the 
documentation suggests it does not honor SHELL, so SHELL=/bin/false does 
not block this).  If permissions/SELinux contain that, they will also 
work against a procmailrc parser exploit.  In other words, I don't think 
there's a security bug here.
