Subject: Re: CVE request: procmail heap overflow in getlline()

FWIW I don't have a specific PoC/scenario to supply for this case that 
serves as an exploit with untrusted input, but I am not familar enough 
with procmail and how it is used to make a judgement on if some related 
code-path/scenario could be exploitable.

I reported this as a security bug due to the implied high risk level of 
procmail being suid-root on Debian, and thus deserving of more detailed 
inspection. But that's a distribution issue.
