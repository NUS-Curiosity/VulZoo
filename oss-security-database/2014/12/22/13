Speaking as one who had to feed and water an OpenLDAP system that was 
replicating all over the world, I really cared whether *this* event 
happened before or after *that* event, but yeah, most users don't need to 
do that.

You haven't lived until you've debugged a replication problem; "Boss, are 
both these systems running NTP?"  "Yes, Dave."  "Right, in that case, I've 
found another obscure bug in OpenLDAP."  When you've got more than one 
person updating the same object at around the same time, it was really 
helpful, in an LDAP sense, to know the precise order of events, as the 
whole concept of replication depends upon it.

I suspect that we humans, the geekier we become, the more precise are our 
perceived needs; just listen to any time announcement over the telephone: 
"At the third stroke, it will be six o'clock precisely" (with the precise 
bit happening at the start of the third beep, and I was fanatic over 
that).
