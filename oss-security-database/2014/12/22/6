Basically to agree with Kurt: reconciling logs across multiple systems
often requires clocks to agree to within a few milliseconds a most.
The log files you're trying to reconcile may be from machines on
different continents as well which is why ntp is so useful: everyone
has the same idea of time.  The potential for an added or removed
second at end of of June and December can cause some excitement.

I've also known a one or two second discrepancy break 'make'.   That
was probably more to do with the fragility of that particular build
system rather than a a clock synchronization issue, but the point is
that properly accurate time is important to a lot of people.
