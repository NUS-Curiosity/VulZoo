FWIW, we've measured 1-2.5% degradation in our highly-optimized x86_64
binaries, and Sri's patch avoids most of it.

Sri also tells me that H.J. Lu committed a patch for pie+copyrelocs to
GNU-ld, and made the GCC copyreloc optimization (which has been
committed) the default when linker support is available.
