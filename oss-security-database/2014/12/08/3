Like Lionel explained in last reply, the term *security* has different
meaning in the different context. Don't give me wrong, I love
GNU/Linux( GCC/GLIBC/KERNEL), which are fundamentals of the FOSS
ecosystem. I've been always telling my customers/friends that
GNU/Linux( with vanilla kernel) is more secure than M$-windows. But
Grsecurity/PaX is the must-need stuff to those who has some digital
assets in a critical scene.

I wish I could. Debian/Mempo or hardened-Gentoo can satisfy my daily bread.

Do you think the mitigations of NX+ASLR+PIE+STACK CANARY can be
defeated in a few seconds is not a big deal? What do you mean about
"this option isn't enabled"? The most of suid programs has been
shipped with these mitigations: NX/ASLR/PIE/STACK
CANARY/FORTIFY...some are compiled with RELRO. What I mean is this
issue should be fixed by the upstream, not let distro community to
maintain a tiny patch.
