Subject: CVE request: OpenSSH ~/.k5users patch (Fedora and downstreams)

In a Kerberos environment, the Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 
version of the OpenSSH server allows remote, authenticated users to log 
in as another user if they are listed in a ~/.k5users file of that other 
user.  This unexpectedly alters the system security policy, as expressed 
through the ~/.k5users file, because previously, users would have to log 
in locally, potentially requiring different forms of authentication, 
before they could use the ksu command to switch users.
