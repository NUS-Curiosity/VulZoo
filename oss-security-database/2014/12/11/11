0.21.6 is out and seems to incorporate the fixes from Jean-Francois 
Dockes (with reformatting). Expecting to find security mentioned in 
ChangeLog or other docs is too much, I guess.

I've fuzzed unrtf with the patch from Fabian Keil a bit and I've found 8 
crashes (with different RIP). All of them are fixed in the version by 
Jean-Francois Dockes (and hence in the release). If someone wants to 
take a look at them I can upload them somewhere.

OTOH unrtf seems to be a recursive program:

$ perl -e 'print "{" x 100000' > test.rtf
$ unrtf-0.21.6/src/unrtf -P unrtf-0.21.6/outputs test.rtf
Segmentation fault
