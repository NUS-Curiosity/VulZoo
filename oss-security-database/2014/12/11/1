Subject: CVE request: Python, standard library HTTP clients

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello all,

I'm request a CVE for CPython (sometimes Python), for failure to validate
certificates in the HTTP client with TLS.

Title: Python standard HTTP libraries fail to validate TLS certificates for
HTTPS
Products: CPython, all 2.x versions prior to 2.7.9, 3.x versions prior to
3.4.3
Description:

When Python's standard library HTTP clients (httplib, urllib, urllib2,
xmlrpclib) are used to access resources with HTTPS, by default the
certificate
is not checked against any trust store, nor is the hostname in the
certificate
checked against the requested host. It was possible to configure a trust
root
to be checked against, however there were no faculties for hostname
checking.

This made MITM attacks against the HTTP clients trivial, and violated RFC
2818
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3).

Python 2.7.9 has been issued to resolve this issue. It is also resolved in
3.4.3, which has not yet been released.

Thanks,
Alex
