This looks like expected behaviour:

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Installation_Guide/sn-firstboot-systemuser.html

"Check the Make this user administrator box if you would like

gives you access to all administrative functions, including installing
and updating software, creating and altering configuration files, and
administering other users."
