Yeah I looked into this (the article/etc was completely confusing and
took some time to parse):

1) the article states they contacted red hat, we were unable to find
any inbound email or bugzilla entry pertaining to this issue, as always
if you have an issue you wish to report please contact secalert@...hat.com

2) this is expected behaviour, admin users can install software (do I
have to say this? really? yes. I was told I should say this).

3) don't run web apps as admin users (do I have to say this? really?
yes. I was told I should say this).

4) if you feel the need to run a web app as an admin user restrict what
they can do via SELinux, and  don't let them install software (do I have
to say this? really? yes. I was told I should say this).

So TL;DR: it's not a security vulnerability, and it will NOT be getting
a CVE.

I can only assume this article/vuln is perhaps referring to something
like Cpanel and other control panels that people sometimes install
insecurely/improperly and then never update. Or something. Who knows.
