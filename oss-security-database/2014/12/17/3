Subject: What is the "Grinch" polkit/wheel group issue?

Hi,

This probably needs a CVE too, or does it have one?

Although it seems that the user is in the "wheel" group for this to be exploitable
and is hard to specify what actions should be safed by another query or which should not.

Ciao, Marcus
