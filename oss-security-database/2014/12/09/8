These two articles from NLNetlabs and ISC might help, they are more verbose than ours:

I’m happy to answer followup questions.

Somebody asked me to (help him) check djbdns today, which we’ll do. Any other implementations you are interested in? I have a lab setup for this issue so I’m happy to check.

I’m convinced the loop could involve unwilling victims (unless they send responses that break the loop!), but I have not tried this in practice.

Kind regards,
