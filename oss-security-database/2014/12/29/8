Subject: CVE Request(s): GnuPG 2/GPG2

Hi,

I found multiple vulnerabilities in GPG2.
Could some CVE-ID(s) be assigned please.
Patches were provided by multiple people.

Double free in scd/command.c:

Double free in sm/minip12.c:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773472


These two seem related in code:
Return after free in sm/gpgsm.c:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773473
Return after free in dirmngr/ldapserver.c:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773523

Thanks,
