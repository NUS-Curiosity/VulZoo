Absolutely. Lintian has a check for RPATH (but not for RUNPATH, AFAICT); 
alas, it doesn't distinguish between security and non-security problems:
https://lintian.debian.org/tags/binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath.html
(NB, this is where I spotted the bug.)

I requested a separate tag for relative RPATH a while ago:
https://bugs.debian.org/732682
Now we "only" need someone to write the code. :-)

The wiki page has a link to lintian.debian.org.
