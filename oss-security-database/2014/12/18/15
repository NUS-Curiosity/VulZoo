Aha, thanks. Security vs. non-security is perhaps not a disaster:
"serious, certain" would already be an improvement over not flagging
this at all.

Great! Is that all we need? The tests reference the Debian policy manual
(package debian-policy):

https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html

(for completeness: also sections 10.2, 10.3).

This references neither RPATH nor RUNPATH. Perhaps we need to fix that
first?

Suggested addition:

8.7 RUNPATH and RPATH
Libraries that define RPATH or RUNPATH should ensure that this does not
contain relative paths. This is to prevent an executable from loading a
library from an untrusted location. (This should include the corner
cases whereby the path starts or ends with a colon, or includes two
consecutive colons).


Did I miss anything?
