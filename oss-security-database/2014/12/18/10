Could this have been caught in package QA with an automated check on
R(UN)PATH? 

(If that exists, how did it get missed? If not, could it be added?
Where? https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org).


Alternatively: is there ever a good argument for truly relative (ie not
"relative to $ORIGIN") R(UN)PATH? What would break if runtime linkers
did not accept relative R(UN)PATHs?
