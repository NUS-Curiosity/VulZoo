I should point out that our research is not on simple downgrade attacks.
These are kinda obvious by the design of STARTTLS if you implement it
in an opportunistic way.

The buffering vulnerabilities we found are in STARTTLS implementations
that have the expectation to enforce a secure connection, but suffer
from various vulnerabilities in the implementation.
