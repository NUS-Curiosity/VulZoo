We have not looked much into other protocols, and given how much time
we've already spent on the topic I think it is unlikely that we will do
this.

Of course it's a very obvious idea for further research to look if one
finds similar vulnerabilities to the ones we found in other protocols.
So I'd really like to encourage other people to look for this.

FWIW there are a lot of protocols with a STARTTLS mechanism, here's the
list of supported protocols by OpenSSL:
	smtp
	pop3
	imap
	ftp
	xmpp
	xmpp-server
	telnet
	irc
	mysql
	postgres
	lmtp
	nntp
	sieve
	ldap
