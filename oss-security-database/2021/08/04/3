With the caveats that I mentioned in my earlier reply to the thread as
I'm not clear on what "vouch" means here.

In the past, I've vouched for people that I personally know and have
worked closely with.

I need to make it clear that this "vouch" for Jeremy doesn't meet that
bar. I've digitally crossed paths with Jeremy a few times and, based on
those interactions, can believe that he'd be doing security response
work for Pop!_OS. That's all I can say. I'd be a lot more comfortable if
someone could provide a stronger vouch.
