Subject: GPSD time will jump back 1024 weeks at after week=2180
 (23-October-2021)

Hi,

the following mail is from the gpsd-users list, forwarding it as this will
most likely affect a lot of ntp servers and various self driving/navigating
vehicles/submarines/.... Please note that I did not check how chrony/ntpd
handle sudden jumps back in time from gps.

I know that upstream does not care about CVEs, but due to the widespread use
of gpsd assigning a CVE might be warranted.

Yo All!

Fair warning.  Issue 144: https://gitlab.com/gpsd/gpsd/-/issues/144

"GPSD time will jump back 1024 weeks at after week=2180 (23-October-2021)"

The offending commit was after 3.19, so only 3.20, 3.21 and 3.22 are
affected:

    commit cb7367496f6dd5f90c6b067c031b327921a857b2
    Author: Gary E. Miller <gem@...lim.com>
    Date:   Tue Oct 8 17:04:54 2019 -0700

The commit 7f30d88d fixes the problem for those that want to try to back port
the fix. You'll just be without all the other bug fixes..

This is a real good reason to get 3.23 out very soon.  Please test!

Cheers,

Bernd
