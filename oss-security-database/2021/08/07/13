Hi Ariadne,

[Dropping the Debian-specific recipients as this is no more related to
the maintenance of Debian's lynx package.]

I agree that it looks a bit unconventional and unintuitive. But I
assume this is because Lynx is actually older than the WWW. According
to Wikipedia[1], Lynx "is oldest web browser still being maintained,
having started in 1992". It was initially written for another
hypertext protocol (something university-internal and gopher-ish
according to Wikipedia -- English and German Wikipedia tell slightly
different stories here).

So it has quite some amount of history in its code and probably
especially in its code structure. And compared to those nearly 30
years, the Host header probably came in only after 5 years of
developement with HTTP/1.1 in 1997 or so. (And SNI much, much later,
kinda "just recently".) So I kinda have some understanding for this
unintuitive locations as most of the code is historically grown.

Then again, big kudos to Thomas Dickey for still maintaining and
developing Lynx. It can't be that easy to maintain a niche program
with a code base which such a long history.
