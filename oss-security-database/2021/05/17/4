I'd have preferred to shitpost @ full-disclosure but their moderation
process is too slow nowadays (last update May 13). Hopefully it improves
in the future.

    Because if you want me to "act professional", I can tell you that I'm
    not interested. I'm sitting in my home office wearing a bathrobe. The
    same way I'm not going to start wearing ties, I'm *also* not going to
    buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and
    backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because
    THAT is what "acting professionally" results in: people resort to all
    kinds of really nasty things because they are forced to act out their
    normal urges in unnatural ways.        - Torvalds, Linus (2013-07-15)
