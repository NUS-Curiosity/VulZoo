Subject: CVE-2021-3509: Ceph: Cross Site Scripting via token Cookie

Hello,

A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage Dashboard. In response to
CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved  from localStorage to an httpOnly
cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body  of the HTTP response
for the documentation, ensuring that the vulnerability remains.

We have assigned it a CVE of CVE-2021-3509, and released patches for it.
