Subject: [CVE-2021-22903] Possible Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack

There is a possible Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack. This
vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2021-22903.

Versions Affected:  >= v6.1.0.rc2
Not affected:       < v6.1.0.rc2
Fixed Versions:     6.1.3.2

Impact
------
This is similar to CVE-2021-22881: Specially crafted Host headers in
combination with certain "allowed host" formats can cause the Host
Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious
website.

Since rails/rails@...7ea5, strings in config.hosts that do not have a
leading
dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This
causes,
for example, config.hosts << "sub.example.com" to permit a request with a
Host
header value of sub-example.com.


Releases
--------
The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
The following monkey patch put in an initializer can be used as a
workaround:

```ruby
class ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization::Permissions
  def sanitize_string(host)
    if host.start_with?(".")
      /\A(.+\.)?#{Regexp.escape(host[1..-1])}\z/i
    else
      /\A#{Regexp.escape host}\z/i
    end
  end
end
```

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

soon
as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security
