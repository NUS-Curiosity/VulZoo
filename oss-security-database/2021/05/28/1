Subject: Re: Linux kernel: net/can/isotp: race condition leads to local
 privilege escalation

Hello Greg,

this patch ("can: isotp: prevent race between isotp_bind() and 
isotp_setsockopt()") has hit Linus' tree ~36h ago:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/can?id=2b17c400aeb44daf041627722581ade527bb3c1d

It has a CVE number and is potentially exploitable - but it was not in 
the latest batch of stable kernels about ~4h ago.

It was obviously not tagged properly for stable kernels but has a fixes-tag:

Fixes: 921ca574cd38 ("can: isotp: add SF_BROADCAST support for 
functional addressing")

which was introduced in 5.11

Thanks for taking care!

Best,
Oliver
