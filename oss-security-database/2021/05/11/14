Yes! After the second STARTTLS we send an invalid MAIL FROM command (for
example, "MAIL FROM:(\"${run{...}}\")\n"). Exim then responds with a 501
error message that includes our "${run{...}}" string, and since corked
in tls_write() is still non-NULL, this string is written to where the
used-after-free corked points to.

Hopefully this helps!

Thank you very much for your mail!
