Hi,

Here are a couple of updates on what was said in this thread earlier.

Things started changing regarding home directory permissions on Ubuntu:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-discuss/2020-November/018842.html
https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/private-home-directories-for-ubuntu-21-04-onwards/19533

Alex Murray from Canonical proposed "that it is time we moved ahead and
stopped creating home directories as world-readable on Ubuntu".  Later
he added: "since there was no opposition to this proposal, I have
uploaded updated adduser and shadow packages to hirsute-proposed to
support setting the mode of home directories to 750 by default when they
are created via either adduser or useradd."

The release notes for Sailfish OS 4.0.1 include this:

"Contributions from Aurora OS
[...]
Security: Isolation of applications (a.k.a. application sandboxing)
implemented for the platform (core) apps, based on Firejail app
sandboxing."
