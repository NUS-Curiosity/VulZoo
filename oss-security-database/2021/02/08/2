Subject: Remote code execution in connman

Hi,

Tesla has reported a remote (adjacent network) code execution flaw in
connman, a lightweight network manager, to our SUSE colleage and
connman upstream maintainer Daniel Wagner,

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/commit/?id=e4079a20f617a4b076af503f6e4e8b0304c9f2cb

Mitre has assigned CVE-2021-26675.

The commit fixes a stack buffer overflow that can be used to execute code by network adjacent attackers.

Mitre has assigned CVE-2021-26676

Remote stack information leak which can be used to help execute CVE-2021-26675 reliably.

Ciao, Marcus
