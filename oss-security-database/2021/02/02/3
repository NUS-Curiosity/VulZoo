You mean for January.  Yes.

Occasionally there will be an issue that should have already been made
public but actually wasn't yet, or not on oss-security.  An issue where
others responsible failed to ensure its timely and proper public
disclosure.  In such cases, I expect the person working on the
statistics task would notice that and help ensure this issue is made
public without further delay and properly (such as by pinging others to
do it), and only then will post the statistics including the issue.  In
fact, if the statistics task is correctly worked on, such issues with
issues are impossible not to notice: every issue in the published raw
data for the statistics should have its corresponding oss-security
posting referenced.  So you'd notice when trying to fill in that field.
