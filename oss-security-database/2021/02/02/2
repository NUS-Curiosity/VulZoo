As part of planning on getting this going again, I want to just review
the cadence and update duration.

I think this is easiest to do on the 15th of every month for the
previous month.  As example, on 2/15, we would post the statistics for
February.  Since the maximum embargo duration is 2-weeks, this would not
disclose any embargoed information.

Does this seem reasonable?
