Current thinking is to setup a private git repository with the various
scripts for generating the wiki report + a running tally of stats from
the list.

This allows for a backup to watch the repo and make sure the stats are
being gathered and backfill/publish if necessary.

This isn't something we had before and I think it will help solve this
problem and also let the infrastructure be carried forward.

We can probably also publish the repository publicly as long as it
trails by two weeks so no on-going issues are disclosed prematurely.
