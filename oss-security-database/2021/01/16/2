Subject: MATE screensaver screen lock bypass with external monitor

Given the discussion about a cinnamon screensaver crash vuln, I was
recently made aware of this issue in mate-screensaver:

https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/183

It seems by a series of plugging in and out external monitors with mate
screensaver you can see the screen content despite the screen being
locked.
