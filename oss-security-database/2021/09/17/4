Subject: Re: Containers-optimized OS (COS) membership in the linux-distros list

Hello Oleksandr,

You posted this from @google.com, which probably means many subscribers
didn't receive the message because of that domain's strict DMARC policy.
So I fully quote your message below for others to possibly comment.

BTW, you will similarly need to be posting from another domain (e.g.,
gmail.com) to the linux-distros list.

Overall, your proposal looks reasonable to me at first glance.

Please also propose which specific contributing-back task(s) your team
would like to help with.

Thanks,

Alexander
