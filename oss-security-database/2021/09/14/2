No worries - I figured it was that time of year, and this isn't something
that has to be resolved immediately.

Thanks.

Okay - a more typical application form follows.

That seems like something we could help with.  I also note that there are
many vulnerabilities we discover in the FOSS packages we ship that never
make it to this list - when the researchers or project maintainers don't
send notices to oss-security, should folks like us at least give a heads
up here?

One obvious one in the last week was the highly publicized Ghostscript
"0 day" - aka CVE-2021-3781, for which the upstream bug report is at
https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704342 and media report at
https://therecord.media/ghostscript-zero-day-allows-full-server-compromises
(and yes, as noted in the above quote, an actual report to the list
  needs more details than just these url's).

Of course, we ship a smaller subset of FOSS than most Linux distros do,
so we won't spot everything, but can help contribute to a larger effort.

Oracle Solaris 11.4 is the latest version of an unbroken chain going back
over 35 years through Oracle & Sun Solaris releases, and SunOS before that.
Updates are posted monthly to our support repositories, as reported in our
public blog at https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/ and interim relief is
provided to support customers between those releases.

While our kernel and many core OS components are closed source, the majority
of packages in our package repository are external Open Source.  A list of
the over 1000 open source components shipped in the Solaris 11.4 release in
August 2018 is at:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37838_01/html/E61065/osplg-tparty.html

Current build recipes for most of the FOSS packages we ship in current updates
can be found at https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland/ or in the FOSS
source release archives at:
https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/solarisx86/b/opensource/o/sol-11_4_37_101_1-opensource_1.zip
https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/solarisx86/b/opensource/o/sol-11_4_37_101_1-opensource_2.zip

https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/solarisx86/b/opensource/o/sol-11_4_37_101_1-opensource.digest.txt
(Those zip files primarily bundle in the external source archives that are
  just referenced in the github repo, providing a permanent copy of the code
  should the upstream download URL's stop working at some point.)

The Solaris organization has a track record going back decades for fixing
security issues, as seen on:
https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/sunalertslisting.html
https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/#SolarisThirdPartyBulletin

As for timeliness:

We learned about CVE-2021-3156 in sudo from the oss-security posting on
January 26, 2021 and made interim relief available to customers on January 28.

We learned about CVE-2020-1971 in OpenSSL from the public disclosure on
December 8, 2020, and made interim relief available to customers on December 16.

We learned about CVE-2019-14287 in sudo from the oss-security posting on
October 14, 2019, and made interim relief available to customers on October 22.

Solaris is different enough that we can't rely on another distro and must
maintain our own package sets.  There are Oracle products downstream of us
who would be releasing fixes for their product using our work - these include
the ZFS Storage Appliance, SPARC SuperCluster, and MiniCluster.

I have been a member of oss-security since at least 2013, acting as both a
distro maintainer and as a representative of the X.Org upstream security team:
https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&w=4&r=1&s=Coopersmith&q=b

Casper has similarly been participating in oss-security for years, and earlier
lists such as bugtraq for decades, while Pavel has been monitoring oss-security
for issues we need to address in our packages.

We accept the policies as currently stated on

See previous discussion.

We are, and will provide PGP keys.

See previous discussion.  As well, in preparing this, John Haxby agreed to
vouch for Casper & I, and Ritwik Ghoshal agreed to vouch for all three of us.
