Hi Alan,

I'm sorry for the delayed response.

I'm happy to vouch for you and Casper, and you can then vouch for Pavel.

I think it's best to separately add Oracle Solaris to the distros list.

There has been no such precedent so far (the two *BSDs were subscribed
before the "contributing back" tasks were introduced).  The below task
looks suitable (and I'd appreciate help on it):

 Administrative tasks mostly unrelated to (linux-)distros lists (but
relevant to the wider community)

    Help ensure that each message posted to oss-security contains the
most essential information (e.g., vulnerability detail and/or exploit)
directly in the message itself (and in plain text) rather than only by
reference to an external resource, and add the missing information
(e.g., in your own words, by quoting with proper attribution, and/or by
creating and attaching a properly attributed text/plain export of a
previously referenced web page) and remind the original sender of this
requirement (for further occasions) in a "reply" posting when necessary

I don't insist on you taking any task, though - especially considering
that you'd have reduced exposure (only on distros) and that Oracle is
already giving back (for the Oracle Linux subscription).  Your
willingness to separate Linux vs. Solaris is helping to reduce risks,
and shouldn't have a further cost to you.
