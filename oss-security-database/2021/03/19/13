I've been following this discussion with interest this week. This list 
probably has lots of security researchers and kernel devs subscribed, 
but I'd like to share a point of view as someone who is neither of 
these, just a heavy user of open source professionally and personally 
the past 20 years.

I've always compiled my own kernels from upstream kernel.org stable 
releases for all machines I look after. I know I'm in the minority and 
stupid for making life harder for myself, but I prefer it that way. I 
follow the upstream stable list as much as I can, read commit messages 
of releases. I try to be as aware as I can about security issues so I 
can keep my boxes secure, and this list has been an invaluable source of 
info to me for many years. Thanks to the moderator who I'm sure has a 
very difficult job at times.

It is certainly evident to me that the "quality" of security 
announcements made by researchers, organisations, maintainers, in 
general varies greatly. For someone in my shoes, when an announcement is 
made that includes plenty of specific information, I appreciate it so 
much. For most software, lack of info in a vulnerability announcement is 
not a big deal and I often go hunting for info on a project's website or 
git repo and can relatively easily find it. But the kernel is so 
gigantic now that quality, specific info in an announcement, to someone 
like me who builds their own kernels, makes all the difference.

This is OSS, there are many volunteers, nobody owes anyone anything, 
that's fine, I'm grateful for anyone's efforts whatever they are. I'm 
especially mindful of that when reading a security announcement from a 
small project with 1 dev working in their spare time. But at the other 
end of the scale are the giants who make a lot of money from the kernel 
and have a lot of resources. None of them owe me anything, I'm not their 
customer or partner. But I certainly look at them a lot differently than 
the small project. I notice how they behave in this community, and I am 
certainly much less generous when forming an opinion about them.

Red Hat contributes a lot, hires a lot of developers, I respect them and 
what they do, Fedora is a great distro. The security write-ups on their 
website about vulnerabilities are often excellent. But I'm sorry to say 
that in my view, which I know is not worth a cent, the security 
announcements they've made on this list this week have been very thin on 
detail, and they have appeared completely uninterested in improving 
them. I completely understand the frustrations expressed by Greg and 
Sasha as a result. A company the size of Red Hat, with their resources, 
involved in kernel development as much as they are, I'm sure would agree 
themselves that they should be doing a lot better. But to the individual 
sending the announcements, please know I don't believe you are at fault 
here in any way, my criticism goes to Red Hat as an organisation which I 
respect and wish to see do better in this particular aspect of their 
involvement in the community.

Right, thanks for listening, back to lurking in the shadows ...
