Agreed. And while we can't require that, it would be awesome if it were
done systematically instead of picking a random commit here and there
and assign it a CVE.

I suppose we can't *require* them, but it's a matter of curtesy, right?
They already have that information, and instead of making a bunch of
other people do the same job they could just share the information to
begin with.

Exactly, they already must have this information, which is where some of
the frustration around these notifications comes from: it reads as
nothing more than a lip service.

They should, but look at the original announcement mail in this thread:
it's so generic and lacks so much information that it can't possibly
inform anyone of an issue.

"There's a bug in the kernel and we assigned a CVE!"

Sure, that makes sense. I'm not disagreeing that distro specific issues
are relevant here, but pretend that you're a downstream of RHEL and read
the original announcement in this thread, how would you act? would you
know what to merge? on to which versions?

What's the value of these announcements then?
