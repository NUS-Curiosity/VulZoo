 synchronization in flush_to_ldisc() can lead to DoS

Hello,

we are reviewing our approach to sending CVE kernel announcements to
oss-security after the (mostly) constructive feedback received in this
email thread.

I admit that several of the recent announcements were not up to par with
the minimal standard we strive to achieve and I apologize for that. Our
intention never was to cause unnecessary work for others, quite the
opposite.

Thank you,
