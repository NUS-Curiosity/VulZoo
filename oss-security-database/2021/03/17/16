Ah, so the above text should have said "of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Kernel release XX.XX only", right?

Given that the above CVE is not public in any database that I can find,
one can only hope that the text will reflect what really is happening
here.  Rohit, why was this even published?

Again, stuff like this is just causing extra work by everyone else for
no good reason that I can see.

Rohit, PLEASE work on making these types of "announcements" reflect what
is actually happening.  I understand your company process rules require
the assignment of CVEs to issues to make things get resolved easier, but
that doesn't mean you should inflict that pain on the rest of the
world...

thanks,
