I chose not to assign a CVE after consulting with security@...nel.org 
and proceeded to handle the issue as a regular bug. Local denial of 
service bugs that require specially crafted file systems and the 
elevated privileges required to mount them, are generally not considered 
security issues worthy of CVEs by the kernel community. It's a 
borderline case but I have no issues with this new CVE assignment.

Best regards,
Wolfgang
