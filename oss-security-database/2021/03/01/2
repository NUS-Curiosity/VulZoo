Subject: CVE-2021-25329: Apache Tomcat Incomplete fix for CVE-2020-9484

The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 
10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41, 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 or 7.0.0. to 
7.0.107 with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be 
used, the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note 
that both the previously published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and 
the previously published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to 
this issue.
