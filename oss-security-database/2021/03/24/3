Subject: CVE-2020-1946: Apache SpamAssassin has an OS Command Injection
 vulnerability

Description:

In Apache SpamAssassin before 3.4.5, malicious rule configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands without any output or errors. With this, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios.  In addition to upgrading to SA version 3.4.5, users should only use update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places.
