It's not really Red Hat's fault that there are six hundred "stable"
kernel versions, which each change approximately weekly.  It's generally
not worth tracking, and it would not be sane to expect Red Hat to seek 
or announce CVEs for git branches they don't maintain.

They should have included the details which they later added, but I
can't even remember the last time Red Hat reported a kernel
vulnerability which contained enough information to satisfy you, so I
wouldn't really blame them if they gave up trying to please you.

Some people in the Linux kernel community seem to get mad as a hobby,
and measure their success by volume of email sent about it.  Those of
us who administer Red Hat systems generally find the level of detail
sufficient and I for one appreciate Rohit's announcements.  This one
could have been better, I agree.

Since MITRE set about destroying the CVE assignment process, reporting
of CVE assignments has been optional and to be frank we're lucky to get
this much these days.

What's yours?  You don't seem to run RHEL, so why get bent out of shape
if they slip up while reporting a CVE assignment?  I guess more 
accurately, why get bent out of shape *every time* they report a CVE
assignment?  Is it possible for you to just stop, so those of us who
find value in the reports don't have to page through all the complaining
in order to read it?  Or is oss-security just doomed to the "greg is mad
at the email" cycle forever?
