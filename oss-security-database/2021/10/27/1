CVE-2021-30851 seems to be REJECTED (cf.
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30851). Is
there a typo in the CVE id for this one or did the CVE got rejected
later on? The CVE entry only states "Reason: This candidate was
withdrawn by the CVE program." so might give a light indication
towards that the CVE used has a typo and should be another one?

Can you clarify or have any insights here?

Regards,
Salvatore
