BCC'ing Samuel Groß


Salvatore -
  I think 30851 was not issued, and it may have been a mistake here.
There was no other CVE issued as part of WSA-2021-0006 according to
the GitHub repo for the CVE program:
https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/search?q=wsa-2021-0006

if you need a CVE for this, Samuel may be able to sort this out with
the WebKit folks, who also seem to advertise 30851 on their security
advisory site: https://webkitgtk.org/security/WSA-2021-0006.html


Have a good Wednesday,
