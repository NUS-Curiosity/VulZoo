Perhaps a case of "not my problem".

The filesystem layer of many an operating system does not care about filenames.
The only rules, if any, are the special meaning of the hierarchy separator (if
any) and perhaps a string terminator (if any).

Compilers - could be the same thing. As long as the grammar is satisfied,
why should they bother what comes in. ("Write/use better editors and frontends")
