Looks like this might be intentional? Or at least there's an option to 
turn off this behavior:

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/7.25.0/IPython/core/shellapp.py#L219
https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/options/kernel.html#configtrait-InteractiveShellApp.ignore_cwd

However, in some Debian packages (at least 5.8.0-1 from Debian buster), 
even --ignore-cwd doesn't help, because /usr/bin/python3 looks like 
this:

   VERSION="3"
   if [ ! -f /usr/bin/python$VERSION ]
   then
           echo "Please install the python$VERSION package." >&2
           exit 1
   else
           exec python$VERSION -c "import sys; sys.argv[0] = '/usr/bin/ipython$VERSION'; from IPython.terminal.ipapp import launch_new_instance; launch_new_instance()" "$@"
   fi

But "python3 -c" adds cwd to sys.path.
