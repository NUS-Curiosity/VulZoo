Subject: xscreensaver 5.45 crash

Hi,

As the embargo period has ended, I am sharing some details about an
xscreensaver crash that might happen on some setups. There are i) the
original post and ii) reproduction instructions.

My workaround is to stop using xscreensaver on my system. And also I have
disabled TB3 port, instead, using USB-C port only, with the dock.

*i) original posting to distros: *

Hi,
This is a new issue which results in xscreensaver crash. Previously I
have reported a similar issue to the Qubes OS security team. This one
might be affecting other distros therefore posting to this list.

I have a Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen1 Intel laptop and a Lenovo TB3 dock
with vendor firmware 1.19. My T14 laptop has 2 usb-c ports. Previously I
owned a T480s which had the same two ports, and one was for power and
the other was for thunderbolt.

It looks like T14 has changed the behavior of the power port. T480s
could not recognize external screens through the power port, but T14
can. I might be wrong, this is just an observation. So when docking and
undocking, sometimes I use the power port, sometimes the TB3 port.

The behavior in CVE-2021-34557 started after I upgraded the firmware to
v1.19. The Qubes OS security team has released a patched version of
xscreensaver that mitigated the crash, however, it looks like there is a
new variant.

When connected to my 3 monitor setup (two external displays through the
tb3 dock + laptop display), just unplug thunderbolt cable, plug it into
the other port. And repeat vice versa. Within 1-2 attempts, the
screensaver crashes with desktop unlocked. (These reproduction steps do
not always result in a crash. Will work on it to determine how to
reproduce it precisely.)

The stack trace of crashed processes are below. I am not an X11 expert,
and not sure if these are related to each other. Both binaries are from
the latest r4.1 branch of Qubes OS.

I also thought about notifying Lenovo but don't know of an effective
means to ask for their help on the UEFI update.

*ii) reproduction instructions*
Actually I cannot review the code at the moment therefore I don't know if
they are related or not.
However the new issue is reproducible. The steps to reproduce are:

shut down the laptop and dock
connect the dock to the TB3 port
boot the system
log in (3 displays)
lock the screen
plug TB3 cable off
plug it into the USB-C port
screen is unlocked

The unit systemd-coredump@...285-0.service has successfully entered the
'dead' state.
