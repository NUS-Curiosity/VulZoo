Will do, thanks.

Where to go to get a CVE for a "random" open source project is always a bit 
opaque for me. I noticed that I managed to omit the link in my original email, 
this is the guide I was referring to:

(sorry for the broken link)

https://github.com/CVEProject/cveproject.github.io/blob/gh-pages/requester/
