Having said that, one of the big changes in XScreenSaver 6.00 involves
security improvements for this situation, so it's worth noting here:

https://www.jwz.org/blog/2021/04/xscreensaver-6-00-out-now/

	I have significantly refactored the XScreenSaver daemon, the
	component of the XScreenSaver suite that provides screen
	locking on X11 systems.

	These changes greatly reduce the amount of code running in the
	"critical" section: the part of the code where a crash would
	cause the screen to unlock. That critical section is now only
	around 1,800 lines of code, a reduction of roughly 87%.

etc.
