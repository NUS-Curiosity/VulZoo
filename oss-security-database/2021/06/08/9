 IOMMU timeout detection / handling

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-28692 / XSA-373
                               version 2

         inappropriate x86 IOMMU timeout detection / handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

IOMMUs process commands issued to them in parallel with the operation
of the CPU(s) issuing such commands.  In the current implementation in
Xen, asynchronous notification of the completion of such commands is
not used.  Instead, the issuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of
the most recently issued command(s).  Some of these waiting loops try
to apply a timeout to fail overly-slow commands.  The course of action
upon a perceived timeout actually being detected is inappropriate:
 - on Intel hardware guests which did not originally cause the timeout
   may be marked as crashed,
 - on AMD hardware higher layer callers would not be notified of the
   issue, making them continue as if the IOMMU operation succeeded.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest may be able to elevate its privileges to that of the
host, cause host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), or cause information
leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Earlier
versions have not been inspected.

Only x86 systems with in-use IOMMU hardware are vulnerable.  x86 systems
without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable.  On Arm systems IOMMU /
SMMU use is not security supported.

Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can
leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid
the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Igor Druzhinin and Andrew Cooper of Citrix,
and further issues were uncovered by by Jan Beulich of SUSE while trying
to fix the first issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
