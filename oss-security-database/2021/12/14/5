Subject: [CVE-2021-44528] Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware

There is a possible open redirect vulnerability in the Host Authorization
middleware in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
identifier CVE-2021-44528.

Versions Affected:  >= 6.0.0.
Not affected:       < 6.0.0
Fixed Versions:     6.1.4.2, 6.0.4.2, 7.0.0.rc2

Impact
------
Specially crafted "X-Forwarded-Host" headers in combination with certain
"allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action
Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.

Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. For
example,
configuration files that look like this:

```
config.hosts <<  '.EXAMPLE.com'
```

When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted Host header
can be used to redirect to a malicious website.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-22881 and CVE-2021-22942.

Releases
