An attacker doesn't need to SUID a questionable binary, just any binary 
that would then allow to execute commands. e.g. /usr/bin/bash  or less 
obvious but still obvious perl, python, vim, sudoedit,  and 100's of 
other default tools that could be used to an attackers advantage once 
they are SUID.
