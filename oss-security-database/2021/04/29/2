These directories only have patches for CVE-2021-25214 and CVE-2021-25215. 
A patch for CVE-2021-25216 appears to be missing.  In some supported 
branches of Alpine, we erroneously followed a development branch of BIND, 
so I am trying to determine if there is anything I need to backport to 
cover CVE-2021-25216.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide on this.
