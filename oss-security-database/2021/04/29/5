Subject: Nitro Enclaves kernel driver issue

Hi,

An issue was found in the Nitro Enclaves kernel driver codebase [1] 
included in the v5.10 upstream Linux kernel. The fix for it has been 
tested on the AWS side. The issue does not break the isolation or 
security of what is running inside the enclave. Nitro Enclaves already 
assumes that the instance running the Nitro Enclaves kernel driver is 
untrusted.

We would like to thank Mathias Krause from Open Source Security, Inc. 
for reporting and providing a fix for this issue directly to AWS.

The patch [2] will be merged into the latest upstream Linux kernel 
release and into the v5.10+ stable kernel releases.

Thanks,
Andra
