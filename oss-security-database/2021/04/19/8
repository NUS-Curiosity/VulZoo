Also fping is the standard fping, but there is no standard ping so one
would need to coordinate adding the option to a number of different
descendant forks of 4.3BSD ping, before it could be reliably used.

problem will not be coming up with wonderful ideas to solve problems --
the problem will be getting people to implement those wonderful ideas.
