Subject: DNS rebinding vulnerability in npupnp

The server-part of npupnp, a library used to implement UUPnP clients and
servers, is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.

Impact: A remote web server can exploit this vulnerability to trick the
user browser into triggering actions on the local UPnP services
implemented using this library.

This is fixed in v4.1.4.
