JENKINS-65280 / CVE-2021-28165
Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and
servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`. This is how
Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when
run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

Jenkins 2.285 and earlier, LTS 2.277.2 and earlier bundles Jetty 9.4.38 or
earlier with multiple security vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-28165.
This vulnerability may allow unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of
service if Winstone-Jetty is configured to handle SSL/TLS connections.
