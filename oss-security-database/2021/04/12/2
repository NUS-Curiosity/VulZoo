Subject: CVE-2021-29943: Apache Solr Unprivileged users may be able to perform
 unauthorized read/write to collections

Description:

When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication,
Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed
requests using server credentials instead of original client
credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution
on the receiving hosts.

This issue is being tracked as SOLR-15233
