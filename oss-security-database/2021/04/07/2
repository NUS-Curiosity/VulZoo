SECURITY-1721 / CVE-2021-21639
Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not validate the
type of object created after loading the data submitted to the `config.xml`
REST API endpoint of a node.

This allows attackers with Computer/Configure permission to replace a node
with one of a different type.


SECURITY-1871 / CVE-2021-21640
Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not properly check
that a newly created view has an allowed name. When a form to create a view
is submitted, the name is included twice in the submission. One instance is
validated, but the other instance is used to create the value.

This allows attackers with View/Create permission to create views with
invalid or already-used names.


SECURITY-2293 / CVE-2021-21641
promoted builds Plugin 3.9 and earlier does not require POST requests for
HTTP endpoints implementing promotion (regular, forced, and re-execute),
resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to promote builds.


SECURITY-2132 / CVE-2021-22512 (CSRF) & CVE-2021-22513 (permission check)
Micro Focus Application Automation Tools Plugin 6.7 and earlier does not
perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to
attacker-specified URLs using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-2175 / CVE-2021-22510
Micro Focus Application Automation Tools Plugin 6.7 and earlier does not
escape user input in a form validation response.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.


SECURITY-2176 / CVE-2021-22511
Micro Focus Application Automation Tools Plugin 6.7 and earlier
unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for connections to
Service Virtualization servers.
