Agreed, when I first heard about the paper in November I was very
excited to read about it, as I sometimes face skepticism about SC
attacks (less so, now that they appear more in the news). 

Research in the space is important, but this is akin to cutting the
brakes on a bus to see when the drivers or the passengers find out...

To add to things, I don't think the researchers themselves are aware on
how the lkml actually works. They wouldn't be able to assess the result
of their experiment, or prepare a meaningful explanation for the IRB
with such a flawed model. I'm not trying to point fingers at anybody
here, but us academics need to do some soul-seeking in terms of how we
engage with the rest of the software-world.

Thanks,
-Santiago
