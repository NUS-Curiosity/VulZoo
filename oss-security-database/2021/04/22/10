The paper says that they used throwaway Gmail accounts to submit the 
patches.  Frustratingly, they have not identified which patches they 
succeeded in landing in that paper.

However, the paper also claims that they generated these "hypocrite" 
commits using an LLVM-based static analysis tool.

Which means the work introduced by Aditya is likely directly related to 
this experiment, since it has the same "feel" to it.

By mining the LKML archive, it may be possible to find the original set of 
patch submissions by searching for similar keywords as the messages from 
Aditya.  If somebody can do that, then we would be able to determine at 
least some of the emails likely to have originated the patches.
