While it's disappointing that they chose to go about this experiment in a 
way that violated research ethics, it does raise a point that has been 
discussed in the community but frequently shrugged off: the possibility 
that a bad actor might submit legitimate patches until such time that 
they can sneak insecure code through review.

Hopefully a positive of this research is that people will be more likely 
to think about the possibilities of insecure code being walked through the 
front door.

With that said, I think UMN should fire Kangjie Lu.  The approach they 
used in their experiment is literally a textbook example of how *not* to 
do this kind of research.  At least, that's not what *I* remember from 
university.  I suspect they will likely fire Kangjie Lu as a result of 
their investigation.

It seems likely.  However, we may not ever know for sure, because the 
paper says they submitted the patches using a random Gmail account instead 
of their UMN email accounts.  I assume any other attempts they made to 
troll other FOSS projects would have come from random Gmail throwaway 
accounts as well.
