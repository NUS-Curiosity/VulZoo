Supply chain attacks are a real threat to open source projects. The
Linux kernel is not the easiest way to introduce malicious commits.
But other projects like much used pip python modules, npm javascript
modules and ruby gem modules might be less vetted before they accept
commits and that is a serious risk.

Proprietary projects are not immune to supply chain attacks either. An
example is the Encrochat proprietary chat application that was
subjected to a state sponsored supply chain attack last year which
compromised their user's data. Everything that uses automated updates
could be targeted by supply chain attacks.
