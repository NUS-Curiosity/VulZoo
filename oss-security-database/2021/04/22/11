Subject: Re: Malicious commits to Linux kernel as part of
 university study

Hello,

This case demonstrates that the possibility of a supply chain attack is
very high.
If the supply chain attack is sophisticated enough, this case may succeed.
e.g:

One day I committed some code, This code is a normal function.
After Five days, I committed some code, This code also is a normal function.

...

After three month, I committed it dozens of times,  But These committed
code together to form a vulnerability.
I don't know how to better guard against this kind of attack method,  Just
only rely on Human code review?
